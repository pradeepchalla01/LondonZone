        <h3>London Fare Zone</h3>
        <p>The cost of rail service in London are calculated following the London fare zones system which is managed by Transport for London (TfL). All underground stations are mapped to nine fare zones. Zone 1 covers central London while fare zones 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 form concentric rings around it. Stations outside Greater London where fares are set by Transport for London there are three additional zones 7, 8 and 9. They extend into Buckinghamshire and Hertfordshire to include all stations served by TfL services that are outside Greater London. Unlike zones 2â€“6 they do not form complete rings around London.</p>
